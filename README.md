# Speaker-Verification
The Speaker Verification for Password Reset system is designed to allow users to reset their password through voice recognition technology. The system works by capturing a voice sample during the user enrollment process and storing it in a database. When a
user requests a password reset, the system will prompt the user to provide a voice sample to compare against the registered sample. The system uses machine learning algorithms to analyze the voice samples and determine if they match. If the samples match, the user will be able to reset their password. If the samples do not match, the user will not be able to reset their password.

Note: To ensure the accuracy of the system, it is recommended to use a high-quality
microphone and to speak clearly during the registration and password reset processes.
